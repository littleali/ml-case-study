# Task 1
Observing the sky for a duration of 3 minutes yields a 60% probability of spotting a plane. Your assignment is to calculate and explain the probability of spotting a plane within 1 minute based on this observation. Provide a detailed solution outlining the reasoning behind your calculations.

A: Observing a plane in 3 minutes
B: Observing a Plane in 1 minute
P(A) = 0.6
P(Not A) = 1 – P(A) = 1 – 0.6 = 0.4
P(B) = 1 – P(Not B)
Also we know that Probability of event b and event c is P(b)*p(c), so we can say Probability of not observing a plane in 3 minutes is probability of not observing a plane in 1 minute to the power of 3 (P(Not B) ^ 3) 

P(Not B) ^ 3 = P(Not A) = 0.4 => P(Not B) = 30.4 = 0.736806
P(B) = 1 – P(Not B) = 1 - 0.736806 = 0.263194
